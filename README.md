# Hello-World
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow
HI I created this page to look back on my progress so I can see how I've progressed on here.
I'm 25yrs and I like to do new thigs. My goal is to learn how to code and make my code over time better as I progress.
I'm defiantly excited to see other people code and how they implemented new features to code that I can understand and learn form.
